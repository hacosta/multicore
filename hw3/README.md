Problems 1{a,b, and c} are written in C and contain a simple Makefile for compilation.

To compile 1a:
cd 1a;
`make`

Dito for 1b and 1c, the resulting executables are matrix_mult, montecarlo_pi, and parallel_prefix.

For problems 2 and 3, the templates were used as provided. The source code lives in {2,3}/src.
